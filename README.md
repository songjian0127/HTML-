thank you Lele, I'll share my screen now. can you all see my screen? cool.

Now as you can see, this is the Admin Panel. It has two tabs, the user and the task management.

The User Management tab allows me to see all users, to find a specific user, to filter out users with certain role, to show less or more info of users, and to download user data.

I could also allows admin to assign role or delete a user. Let's delete this user because it is just a testing account. now it is deleted. Let's also promote this user to admin. yep, it is successful.

Now let's login with this user account.

As you can see, this user also has admin panel which means our role assignment is successful.

Let's now go to the task management tab.

The task management tab shows all tasks created by each user and shows total tasks count next to their names. 

For my account, I have 5 tasks created. and for this account its got 2 tasks. Let's open it. 

Now as you can see, more information about each task can now be viewed by the admin. Similar to what Ivan demonstrated, for each task, we could view the details, we could download data and finally the admin could delete a task from a certain user. Let's delete this one. Successful!

Thank you. That's all for the admin panel, I'll pass on to Jeremiah now.

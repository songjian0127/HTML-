I'm working on my game project.

help me dissect the project into practical tasks and subtasks from start to end.

I'm using Unreal Engine 5 to build this game. It is a student project which is not complicated. It is not expected for student to design/build assets. Using exisiting assets is fine with minor modifications like changing materials.

The game is 3rd person rogue like.
